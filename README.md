The game starts with a hidden movie title, where only spaces and special characters are visible. Players must guess letters to reveal the title before losing all seven lives. Each incorrect guess reduces a life and triggers a fun Bollywood-themed phrase like “Lights, Camera, Action!” or “Climax scene!” to enhance the cinematic experience.
